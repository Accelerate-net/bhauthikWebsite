        <h2>JAM Coaching</h2>
        <div class='jamp'>
          <h4>Who can attend this course?</h4>
          <p align='justify'>
            Bhauthik's JAM coaching program is particularly designed for the third year BSc Physics students who dream of pursuing their MSc or MSc-PhD dual degree courses in premier institutes such as IITs, IISc, TIFR, NITs, CUSAT, AMU and Central Universities. However, talented and ambitious second-year BSc students are also highly recommended to join our JAM coaching to get an earlier exposure.
        </p>
      <h4>Bhauthik's offer</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We offer rigorous training on both fundamental and advanced concepts through in-depth-explanations and computer simulations. Our exclusive training program focusses on how to tackle tricky questions easily by recognizing the underlying concepts. More importantly, we train students the art of "reading questions" thereby encouraging them to approach any difficult questions without fear. All of our mentors are JAM-qualified (IITians), and you can learn the tips and tricks straight from the horse's mouth. It doesn't matter your current level of understanding; we are here to help you to reach your full potential.
      </p>
      <h4>Class timing</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We take three sessions a week, each consisting of 2 hours from 6.00 PM to 8.00 PM (IST). The first hour discusses essential theoretical concepts, and the next hour dedicates to solving the problems based on the covered theory. After every class, an additional problem sheet will be distributed as an assignment. The solutions to the assignments will be provided in the upcoming class.
      </p>
      <h4>Weekly online test-series</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We conduct online examination series every Sunday based on the topics covered in the past week. Bhauthik has developed this test-series to mimic the real-life experience during an online competitive exam. In addition to the weekly test-series, frequent revision exams will also be conducted.
      </p>
      <h4>Bhauthik predicts your performance in JAM 2021</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        At Bhauthik, we have exclusively developed advanced Machine Learning algorithms to predict the performance of students in the JAM 2021 examination. Such predictions (beta-stage) will help students to rectify their weak-points, thereby significantly boosting their chance to clear JAM 2021.
      </p>
      <p align='justify'>
        Our friendly tutors and technical team members are always ready to clear your doubts asap. During this course you will sit and learn with IITians by solving 1000+ problems and underlying concepts. 
      </p>

        <div class='csirp'><p align='justify'>Our focus is to get a complete post graduate level understanding of the concepts in Physics. We take four sessions a week, each consisting of 2 hours. The first one hour will be spent for learning the concepts and theory, and the next one will be dedicated to solve problems based on the particular topics of the day. An additional set of problems will be given as assignment. Classes will be on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, timed from 6.00 PM to 8.00 PM. Every Sunday, an online exam comprising of questions that appear in the competitive exams will be conducted, and a rank list will be published in the next class. Our technical team will help clear the doubts and unsolved problems sent by the students. There will be additional bonus classes on different topics with live simulations, motivation classes and webinars by researchers and scientists from different parts of the world.</p></div>
