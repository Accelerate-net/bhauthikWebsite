        <h2>JAM Coaching</h2>
        <div class='jamp'>
          <h4>Who can attend this course?</h4>
          <p align='justify'>
            Bhauthik's JAM coaching program is particularly designed for the third year BSc Physics students who dream of pursuing their MSc or MSc-PhD dual degree courses in premier institutes such as IITs, IISc, TIFR, NITs, CUSAT, AMU and Central Universities. However, talented and ambitious second-year BSc students are also highly recommended to join our JAM coaching to get an early exposure.
        </p>
      <h4>Bhauthik's offer</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We offer rigorous training in both fundamental and advanced concepts through in-depth-explanations and computer simulations. Our exclusive training program focusses on how to tackle tricky questions easily by recognizing the underlying concepts. More importantly, we train students in the art of "reading questions" thereby encouraging them to approach any difficult questions without fear. All our mentors are JAM-qualified (IITians), and you can learn the tips and tricks straight from the horse's mouth. It doesn't matter your current level of understanding; we are here to help you to reach your full potential.
      </p>
      <h4>Class timing</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We take three sessions a week, each consisting of 2 hours from 6.00 PM to 8.00 PM (IST). The first hour discusses essential theoretical concepts, and the next hour is dedicated to solving the problems based on the covered theory. After every class, an additional problem sheet will be distributed as an assignment. The solutions to the assignments will be provided in the next class.
      </p>
      <h4>Weekly online test-series</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
        We conduct online examination series every Sunday based on the topics covered in the past week. Bhauthik has developed this test-series to mimic the real-life experience during an online competitive exam. In addition to the weekly test-series, frequent revision exams will also be conducted.
      </p>
      <h4>Bhauthik predicts your performance in JAM 2021</h4>
      <p align='justify'>
