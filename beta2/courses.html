        <h2>CSIR NET/GATE/JEST Coaching</h2>
        <p align='justify'>Our focus is to get a complete post graduate level understanding of the concepts in Physics. We take four sessions a week, each consisting of 2 hours. The first one hour will be spent for learning the concepts and theory, and the next one will be dedicated to solve problems based on the particular topics of the day. An additional set of problems will be given as assignment. Classes will be on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, timed from 6.00 PM to 8.00 PM. Every Sunday, an online exam comprising of questions that appear in the competitive exams will be conducted, and a rank list will be published in the next class. Our technical team will help clear the doubts and unsolved problems sent by the students. There will be additional bonus classes on different topics with live simulations, motivation classes and webinars by researchers and scientists from different parts of the world.</p>
